## 1 Model 1 User
This phase focuses on developing a model for each user in the dataset. In line with real-world applications, the model is used for authentication purposes, specifically to verify whether the keystroke dynamics match those of the legitimate user, rather than identifying the user based on their keystroke dynamics.

## Applying Ensemble Classifier Voting 
his approach aims to address the research problem by investigating whether the use of an ensemble classifier can improve model accuracy or other evaluation metrics.
