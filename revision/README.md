# Project Revision

## 1 Model 1 User
Focusing on develop the code for 1 model for each user in the dataset. Matching real life use case, the model used for authenticatiion for checking if keystroke dynamics matching the real user, not identify who is the user based on the keystroke dynamics.

## Applying Ensemble Classifier Voting 
Fullfilling the research problem statement, find out if using ensemble classifier can increase the model accuracy or the other evalution matrix.
